<h3>Handy's Signature Spaghetti Bolognaise</h3>
<img src="img/spag.jpg" alt="Close up photo of a bowl of spaghetti bolognaise on a table" title="Spaghetti Bolognaise">
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 slug of olive oil and a small knob of butter for frying</li>
<li>500 g lean beef mince</li>
<li>1 large brown onion</li>
<li>1-2 celery sticks</li> 
<li>1 carrot</li> 
<li>2 garlic cloves</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>1 <sub>1/2</sub> cups of dry white wine</li>  
<li>1 700 ml bottle of sugo or passata</li> 
<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li> 
<li>1 tablespoon of white sugar</li>
<li>Mixed Italian herbs</li> 
<li>Salt and pepper to season</li> 
</ul>
<h4>Method</h4>

<ol><li>Dice the onion and celery. (If you’re not a big fan of celery, just use one stick.)</li>
<li>Grate the carrot.</li>
<li>Put olive oil and garlic in pan together with onion, celery and carrot.</li>
<li>Fry for about five minutes or until the onion pieces start to look glassy.</li>
<li>Add the mince and brown it – just until the meat is no longer pink - breaking it up as you go.</li>
<li>Add the milk and cook on a low heat for 20 minutes, until it has reduced.</li>
<li>Add the wine and cook until it has reduced.</li>
<li>Add the sugo/passata, the tomato paste, the sugar, the herbs, the seasoning and mix well.</li>
<li>Bring sauce mixture to the boil then reduce the heat.</li>
<li>Simmer the sauce slowly for 1 -2 hours. Check it regularly to stir and check that there is still enough moisture in the mixture. Add a bit of water if you think the mixture may be a bit too dry.<br> You want the sauce to be moist without being watery.</li>
<li>Cook the spaghetti (or pasta of your choice) according to the directions on the packet.</li>
<li>Serve pasta with sauce and some freshly grated Parmesean or pecorino cheese.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul><li>The milk is added to counter and balance some of the acidity from the wine and tomatoes. You can skip this step if you have limited time.</li>
<li>The sugar is also added to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Skip the sugar if you prefer the sauce without it.</li> 
<li>This Bolognaise sauce tastes even better one or two days after cooking.</li>
</ul>
