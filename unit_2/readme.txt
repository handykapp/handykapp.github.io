These mockups are for a personal website that doesn't have much content yet. Mockups 1 and 2 are my prefered layout for a site with minimal content. Mockup 3 could be used in future if I had more images and a larger portfolio to display.

I didn't like many of the layouts for personal websites and blogs that I found. I prefer sites that are highly visual with minimal text.

Where text dominates a site I like a simple colour palate and the typography to be well-chosen.

I also like the concept of new media paying homage to old media so I could see myself using a newspaper layout (like theforecaster-interactive.com) or even a comic book layout that users could interact with.

Some sites I like that I came across while doing this project are:

www.typegenius.com (simple and built for a specific purpose)
www.onebeing.org (this site got me thinking more about the role of typography in design)
www.belindamason.com (simplicity and strong focus on images)
